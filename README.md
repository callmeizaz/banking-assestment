Sure, here's a basic README template based on our conversation:

# React Next.js Banking App with SQLite and Prisma

This is a simple banking application built with React, Next.js, and SQLite for backend persistence. Prisma is used for database operations. The app allows users to view their checking and savings account balances, transfer funds between accounts, and handles simple exceptions.

## Features

- View checking and savings account balances.
- Transfer funds between checking and savings accounts.
- Handle simple exceptions.
- Server-side rendering with Next.js.
- Database persistence using SQLite.
- Prisma for database operations.
- Unit tests for frontend and backend components.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed.
- SQLite installed.
- Prisma CLI installed globally: `npm install -g @prisma/cli`.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/callmeizaz/banking-app.git
   cd banking-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

   ```env
   DB_PATH=./path/to/banking.db
   ```

   Replace `./path/to/banking.db` with your desired SQLite database path.

4. Initialize the database:

   ```bash
   npm run prisma:init
   ```

   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   ```

   This will create the SQLite database and initialize the necessary tables.

5. Run the application:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

1. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

2. Use the application to view account balances, transfer funds, and handle exceptions.

## Tests

```
